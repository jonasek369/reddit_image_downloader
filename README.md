idk i made this beacuse i was bord if anyone want to use it here you are
input name of certain reddit 
input certain number of submissions 100=(add to list top 100 submissions on that certain reddit) updated this so it deletes from the list all downloaded images and it continues until it has no images so when you input 100 you download 100 images
you need to change the destination in the main.py in download funcion
